		<h1>Art Wabi Sabi</h1>

		<p><b>Metal clay</b><br>
		Kim Struve, a Senior Certifying Metal Clay Instructor in San Antonio, Texas, chooses industry leaders’ hands-on courses to accelerate her competencies. She has provided metal clay courses to adults and children in large [70] and small groups since 2011. Struve has great student rapport, as one opined, “Kim is an amazing artist with a big heart and open mind; ready to learn from every class she teaches.”
		Love, math and nature influence the designs and passion demands she share the FUNctional, unique and novel. Struve’s “Fold Lock” techniques resulted from a determination to create strong joinery, components, jewelry and art by folding dry metal clay. Kim developed Metal LeatherTM fine silver precision strips to make it simple and waste-free.</p>
		<p><b>Presentation</b><br>
		I have been presenting material and educational information for over 40 years, throughout my business and homeschool careers. I presented several tip and techniques at two Art Clay Instructor Intensives, developed and presented twice, “What’s NOW, New and Next in Metal Clay” at the 2018 Metal Clay Artists Symposium (MCAS) and casualyl presented at MOJO and YCMI. I am regularly asked to present helpful information during my online classes but I only accept at request of the professors.</p>
		<p><b>Instruction</b><br>
		I have been teaching groups and individuals for over 40 years, metal clay for over a dozen, plus we homeschooled our three children. I am a Senior Certifying Instructor. In October 2023, I will begin online instruction. Currently, I am in school full-time for website design – I hope to have them up and running by fall.</p>
		<p><b>Philosophy</b><br>
		I am an intuitive teacher who keeps students’ experiences in mind during class. Slow and confused students are recognized and accommodated without disturbing the balance of students. I am patient and bring peace in times of frustration.</p>
